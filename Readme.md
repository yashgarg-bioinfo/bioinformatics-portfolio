# Bioinformatics Portfolio

Welcome to my bioinformatics portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects where I apply computational tools and biological databases to explore protein structures, gene annotations, molecular interactions, and more.

## Projects

### ðŸ§¬ Protein Structure Prediction
- **Objective**: Predicting the three-dimensional structure of Bovine Cytochrome B(5) using SWISS-MODEL and PyMOL.
- **Tools Used**: SWISS-MODEL, PyMOL.
- **Description**: This project involves modeling the 3D structure of Bovine Cytochrome B(5) to understand its functional regions and stability.
